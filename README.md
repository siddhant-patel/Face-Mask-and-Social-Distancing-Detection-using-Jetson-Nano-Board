# Face Mask and Social Distancing Detection using Deep Learning techniques on Jetson Nano Board

This project presents an approach on how deep learning techniques can be used to detect face masks and social distancing, using the Jetson Nano board. This project is aimed to explore the potential of deep learning techniques for detecting face masks and social distancing using the Jetson Nano board. I trained and tested deep learning models on a dataset of images and videos, and evaluated their accuracy in detecting face masks and social distancing.

## Methodology

I used a dataset of images and videos to train and test the deep learning models, which included MobileNetV2 for face mask detection and YOLOv3 for social distancing detection. The accuracy of the models was evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Results

The deep learning models achieved high accuracy in detecting face masks and social distancing, with F1 scores of 0.98 and 0.96, respectively.

## Discussion

This project could be used in a variety of settings, such as airports, hospitals, and public spaces, to help enforce face mask and social distancing guidelines. I believe that the project demonstrates the potential of deep learning techniques for addressing public health challenges.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive overview of the use of deep learning techniques for detecting face masks and social distancing using the Jetson Nano board. I hope that the findings will be helpful to anyone interested in exploring the potential of deep learning in addressing public health challenges.
